 *  The API contains:
 *    - vertex_initialise(address, recording_flags, n_vertices_value):
 *         translate the data stored in the NEURON_PARAMS data region in SDRAM
 *         and converts it into c based objects for use.
 *    - vertex_set_input_buffers(input_buffers_value):
 *         setter for the internal input buffers
 *    - vertex_do_timestep_update(time):
 *         executes all the updates to neural parameters when a given timer
 *         period has occurred.
