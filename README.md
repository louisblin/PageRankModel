# Page Rank Neuron Model

Neuron model based on 
[sPyNNaker 4.0.0](https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/sPyNNaker/tree/4.0.0) 
using PyNN 0.8 to implement model where a neuron represent a vertex in the Page 
Rank algorithm.

This was moved to my 
[final year project](https://github.com/louisblin/FYP) under `python/page_rank/model`.
