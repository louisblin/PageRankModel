# Page Rank Neuron Model

Neuron model based on 
[sPyNNaker 4.0.0](https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/sPyNNaker/tree/4.0.0) 
using PyNN 0.8 to implement model where a neuron represent a vertex in the Page 
Rank algorithm.


This is a sub-repository of my 
[final year project](https://github.com/louisblin/FYP) where documentation / 
examples will be maintained.
